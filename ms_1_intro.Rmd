# Introduction

Knowing where species exist and thrive is fundamental to the sciences of ecology, biogeography, and conservation, among many others.  This knowledge provides foundational information for 
 understanding species ranges and diversity,
 predicting species responses to human impacts and climate change,
 and managing and protecting species effectively.
<!--___A rich literature tackles the many dimensions of these questions.___-->

One major outcome of this body of science is the various compiled databases of species distribution maps. Two global-scale repositories predict marine species ranges throughout the world's oceans â€“ AquaMaps [@kaschner_aquamaps:_2015] and International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) [@iucn_iucn_2015].  These two spatial datasets have been used in hundreds of studies and applications for a wide range of purposes, including assessing marine species status [@halpern_index_2012; @halpern_patterns_2015; @selig_assessing_2013-1], evaluating global biodiversity patterns [@coll_biodiversity_2010; @martin_manual_2014; @pimm_biodiversity_2014; @kaschner_current_2011], predicting species range shifts [@garciamolinos_climate_2015], and setting conservation priorities [@klein_shortfalls_2015].

The two datasets ostensibly describe the same information, but significant differences in methodology and intent could lead to dramatically different understandings of our marine ecosystems, with significant implications for policy and conservation recommendations.

There is an objective "truth";

Neither dataset claims to represent the "truth" of a species' spatial distribution, but rather each presents one understanding of the "truth" - one database relying primarily on expert opinion and the other on model predictions.  Uncertainties inherent in the method and intent inevitably drive differences in the range predictions made by each dataset; significant differences could indicate dramatically different understandings of our marine ecosystems, with significant implications for policy and conservation recommendations.  

Inaccurate indications of presence or absence could lead to ineffective marine reserve systems and management plans [@rondinini_tradeoffs_2006; @jetz_ecological_2008].  Importantly, biases in taxonomic or spatial coverage within a dataset could shift management and conservation actions away from places or species that are most in need.

To understand the implications of differences between the AquaMaps and IUCN datasets, we compare how each data source represents the global spatial and taxonomic distribution of marine species.  Most notably, AquaMaps includes range maps for many more species (currently `r format(n_spp_am, big.mark = ',')` species; `r p_spp_am`% of total), such that most global analyses related to marine biodiversity to date have used AquaMaps (IUCN range map data exist for only `r format(n_spp_iucn, big.mark = ',')` unique marine species).  

___It seems fair to assume that/we can reasonably assume that___ range predictions from each dataset would be more closely aligned for well-understood species.  For the `r format(n_spp_both, big.mark = ',')` species (`r p_both_all`% of total) mapped in both datasets, we examine how well the maps align, determine several issues that lead to misalignment between predicted species distributions, and suggest methods to improve confidence in species range predictions. 

We then reexamine two recent marine biodiversity studies - an assessment of the status of global biodiversity within the Ocean Health Index (OHI) [@halpern_index_2012; @halpern_patterns_2015] and a global analysis of gaps in protection afforded by marine protected areas (MPAs) [@klein_shortfalls_2015] - as case studies to explore the implications of prioritizing one data set over the other.  The results highlight possible consequences of different data use decisions on our understanding of marine biodiversity status and protection.

While we cannot recommmend one data set as more accurate than the other, we suggest methods to improve confidence in species range predictions to better inform conservation management and policy decisions.

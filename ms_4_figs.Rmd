For each paired-map species, we calculated two dimensions of spatial alignment: _distribution alignment_, which we defined as the proportion of the smaller range intersecting the larger range (where on the map); and _extent alignment_, which we defined as the ratio of the smaller range to the larger range (how much of the map).  For a species whose distribution is well understood and described in both datasets, we would expect to see a value near 100% for each dimension of alignment.  

``` {r tally_quad_counts, echo = FALSE}
dist_median <- round(median(spp_map_pairs$sm_perc,    na.rm = TRUE), 1)
area_median <- round(median(spp_map_pairs$area_ratio, na.rm = TRUE), 1)
q1_count <- sum(spp_map_pairs$sm_perc >= dist_median & spp_map_pairs$area_ratio >= area_median)
q2_count <- sum(spp_map_pairs$sm_perc <  dist_median & spp_map_pairs$area_ratio >= area_median)
q3_count <- sum(spp_map_pairs$sm_perc >= dist_median & spp_map_pairs$area_ratio <  area_median)
q4_count <- sum(spp_map_pairs$sm_perc <  dist_median & spp_map_pairs$area_ratio <  area_median)
```

* The upper right quadrant (quadrant 1) comprises species whose maps largely agree (better than median value) in both spatial distribution and the extent of described ranges. 
(n = `r q1_count`; `r round(q1_count/nrow(spp_map_pairs) * 100, 1)` %)
* The upper left quadrant (quadrant 2) comprises species whose maps agree well in distribution, but disagree in extent.
(n = `r q2_count`; `r round(q2_count/nrow(spp_map_pairs) * 100, 1)` %)
* The lower right quadrant (quadrant 3) includes species for which the paired maps generally agree in range extent, but disagree on where those ranges lie - a more worrisome mismatch than that indicated by quadrant 2.
(n = `r q3_count`; `r round(q3_count/nrow(spp_map_pairs) * 100, 1)` %)
* The lower left quadrant (quadrant 4) indicates species for which the map pairs agree poorly in both area and distribution. 
(n = `r q4_count`; `r round(q4_count/nrow(spp_map_pairs) * 100, 1)` %)

![Absolute change in SPP score](figures/SPP_scenarios/boxplot_abs_diff.png)

Figure [X] shows the change in status score for the Species Subgoal within the global Ocean Health Index under three different scenarios. 

| Scenario              | Priority data source | AquaMaps presence threshold |
| --------------------- | :------------------: | :-------------------------: |
| Scenario 0 (current)  | IUCN                 |  >= 40%                     |
| Scenario 1            | IUCN                 |   > 0%                      |
| Scenario 2            | AquaMaps             |  >= 40%                     |
| Scenario 3            | AquaMaps             |   > 0%                      |

* Scenario 1 shows the effect of reducing the presence threshold for AquaMaps presence.  Reducing the threshold will always increase the apparent range of a species, therefore the slight decrease in average score suggests increased spatial representation of threatened species.

* Scenario 2 shows the effect of preferring AquaMaps data over IUCN, while maintaining the same presence threshold.  This will have different effects depending on the species; in general, AquaMaps ranges are smaller than IUCN ranges, so many but not all overlapping species will see a decrease in represented range.  The slight bump in mean score may indicate a small increase in spatial representation of low-risk species, a small decrease in spatial representation of high-risk species, or more likely a combination of both.

* Scenario 3 shows the effect of preferring AquaMaps data over IUCN, while eliminating the presence threshold.  Just as a presence threshold of zero in scenario 1 drives a decrease in average score relative to the baseline, the zero threshold in scenario 3 drives a decrease in scores relative to scenario 2.  The large decrease seems to indicate that within the set of paired-map species, a zero threshold greatly increases the spatial representation of high-risk species relative to low-risk species.

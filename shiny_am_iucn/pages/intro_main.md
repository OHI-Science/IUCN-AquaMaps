### Abstract
 
Species distribution data provide the foundation for a wide range of ecological research
studies and conservation management decisions. Two major efforts to provide marine species
distributions at a global scale are the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN),
which provides expert-generated range maps that outline the complete extent of a species'
distribution; and AquaMaps, which provides model-generated species distribution maps that
predict areas occupied by the species. Together these databases represent 24,637 species
(92.9% within AquaMaps, 16.3% within IUCN), with only 2,279 shared species. Differences in
intent and methodology can result in very different predictions of species distributions,
which bear important implications for scientists and decision makers who rely upon these datasets
when conducting research or informing conservation policy and management actions. Comparing
distributions for the small subset of species with maps in both datasets, we highlight several
key examples in which introduced errors drive differences in predicted species ranges. In
particular, we find that IUCN maps greatly overpredict coral presence into unsuitably deep
waters, and we demonstrate that AquaMaps methodology can produce odd discontinuities at the
extremes of a species range. We illustrate the scientific and management implications of these
tradeoffs by repeating a global analysis of gaps in coverage of marine protected areas, and
find significantly different results depending on how the two datasets are used. Efforts to
understand tradeoffs between the two datasets, and ideally to enable the use of both when doing
research that requires information on species distributions, will greatly improve the science
and policy recommendations around understanding, managing, and protecting marine biodiversity.

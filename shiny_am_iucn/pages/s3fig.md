**S3 Fig. Representative species maps to illustrate each quadrant from Fig 2A.** Each map is positioned to match its quadrant in Fig 2A. FAO Major Fishing Area boundaries [16] are outlined in light grey. (A) Distribution-aligned: _Conus episcopatus_, the dignified cone snail. Distributions show excellent overlap in the western Pacific, though IUCN range extends well beyond the bounds of the AquaMaps range. (B) Well-aligned: _Kajikia albida_, the Atlantic white marlin. Distributions from each data set show nearly complete overlap, and very similar range size. (C) Poorly aligned: _Acanthurus nigroris_, the blue-lined surgeonfish. IUCN predicts species distribution only near the Hawaiian islands; AquaMaps predicts extensive distribution throughout the central and western Pacific Ocean. The datasets align in neither distribution nor range size. (D) Area-aligned: _Conus magnificus_, the magnificent cone snail. Distributions overlap in the southern Pacific, but align poorly elsewhere. The range sizes are similar.

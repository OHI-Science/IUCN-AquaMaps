- priorities for conservation
- marine spatial planning
- assessing biodiversity 
- monitor impacts (human, natural) overtime

Species range maps are useful in conservation and management, as well as understanding the spatial distribution of movement and overlap of species in different habitats globally. Marine species prove more difficult to map based on their inherent nature of being difficult to observe and track. Two main sources for marine species are the IUCN and AquaMaps. These two datasets differ in methodology and final products, yet the differences between the two are not well documented. AquaMaps uses a computer model based on preferential environmental parameters to predict species locations and probability of occurrence, while the IUCN uses expert insight to assign spatial boundaries around known locations of marine species. Approximately 1,900 species are found in both datasets and there are very large differences between these maps. Depending on data usage, choosing one of these datasets over the other can lead to potentially large differences in results as exemplified here by the Ocean Health Index as an example.

##Introduction

There have been multiple efforts to map marine species based on both observational data and known life history and habitat preferences. AquaMaps and IUCN are two of these efforts.

##Section One: Understanding each dataset separately

###IUCN

The IUCN conducts global assessments for species [detail assessment process - one paragraph].

Spatial designation of the species distribution is left to the experts with strict guidance for how to assign the designation. Using known occurrence data, experts depict the species distribution by polygons using a systematic methodology laid out by the [IUCN](http://www.amphibians.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Red-List-Mapping-standards-ARLA-Jan2014-web-version.pdf). These maps are meant to act as 'limits of distibution' and should be interpreted as the species 'probably occurs within this polygon, but it does not mean that it is distributed equally within that polygon or occurs everywhere within that polygon'.


**Data Type**  
Shapefiles for individual species. Spatial files include subpopulation information, presence (extinct/extant etc.) and seasonality information (breeding/migration/origin etc.).  

**Methods**  
From [IUCN site](http://www.iucnredlist.org/technical-documents/red-list-training/iucnspatialresources):  

> The species distribution maps, sometimes referred to as 'limits of distribution' or 'field guide' maps, aim to provide the current known distribution of the species within its native range. The limits of distribution can be determined by using known occurrences of the species, along with the knowledge of habitat preferences, remaining suitable habitat, elevation limited, and other expert knowledge of the species and its range. In most cases the range is depicted as polygons. *A polygon displaying the limits of a species distribution is essentially meant to communicate that the species probably occurs within this polygon, but it does not mean that it is distributed equally within that polygon or occurs everywhere within that polygon*.  


###AquaMaps 

[Site](http://www.aquamaps.org/)

AquaMaps (Kirschner et al. 2013) was developed to create species range maps based on a computer model that takes up to six parameters to determine where marine species are located. The model uses known species preferences for sea surface temperature, salinity, depth, productivity, and in some instances distance to land and sea ice cover to predict species ranges. Range maps are based on a 0.5 degree global grid where values in each cell is equal to the probability of occurrence that the species is there. These maps can then be tweaked by experts altering the parameters and regenerating the modeled map. As of October 2015, 17,348 species have been mapped. See (Kirschner et al. 2013) for more detailed methods.


The main differences between these two sources of marine species ranges is how the maps are developed, and their output. When a species range is developed during an IUCN assessment, experts determine the boundaries of the species range based on their expertise which could be using known occurrences, habitat preferences, suitable habitat, or other knowledge. The range is depicted as a polygon where the boundaries are *"meant to communicate that the species probably occurs within this polygon, but it does not mean that it is distributed equally within the polygon or occurs everywhere within the polygon."*


These two differ in spatial resolution - AquaMaps provides higher resolution information about where species do and do not occur globally whereas the IUCN range maps are unable to provide specific information about where within a polygon a species occurs. This is understandable given the mobile nature of many marine species and the difficulty in observing and tracking known occurrences.




AquaMaps uses both occurrence data and environmental parameters to predict relative species occurrence. This approach attempts to reduce sampling bias and fill gaps where data is not available. Six environmental predictors are used to estimate where a species could be found; sea surface temperature, bottom depth, salinity, primary production, sea ice concentration and distance to land. For more information on methods see Kaschner et al. (2007) and online at http://www.aquamaps.org/main/AboutAquaMaps.php.

There are inherent issues with AquaMaps. It can't be expected to accurately predict all marine species ranges. Expert insight is sought and incorporated when available.

##Section Two: Comparison of IUCN and AquaMaps

To compare these two datasets for all species found in each (1920), the IUCN maps were rasterized to the same cell resolution as AquaMaps, 0.5 degrees. For every grid cell where the polygon overlapped, a value of 1 was assigned. To allow for comparison, the probability of occurrence values in the AquaMaps data were ignored and all cells where there was a value greater than 0 were assigned a 1. This way we have comparable maps for total species range.

Using predifined species groups by the IUCN, it is clear to see that tropical species - specifically wrasses, corals, blennies and groupers, make up the majority of species found in both. This is driven more by the IUCN dataset since the number of species with spatial data is directly attributed to the species that have assessments.

For each species map, the total area was calculated for all cells where the species was determined as 'possibly present' by both datasets. Due to large areas and differences, the total area per species was log transformed and then compared to the range map of the same species between datasets. There are differences, mainly driven by differeneces in the wrasses and combtooth blennies, but this could be due to there being more species in both of those species groups.

For each species range map, the total area was calculated for all cells that were included in either species distributions, regardless of source. The number of cells that were found in both

Figure 1 is an example of very large differences in a species range map from the IUCN and AquaMaps datasets. By considering the entire range of the species to be every cell that is in either dataset, only 3.14% of the map is in both. 3.18% is covered just by AquaMaps and 77.3% is covered just by IUCN. Figure 2


This is not always the case as some species range maps align better, especially for marine mammals.

##Section Three: Application to OHI

The global Ocean Health Index (Halpern et al. 2012), an index made up of 10 goals, utilizes both of these datasets to inform the  Biodiversity goal. The biodiversity goal is made up of two parts; Species and Habitats. The species subgoal uses the IUCN range map data and threat status to calculate average species status in global ocean regions around the world. Spatial range maps are developed by experts for species that are assessed. The assessment process happens in phases and only [X] number of marine species have been given spatial range maps. AquaMaps has spatial range maps for over 17,000 species. For those species that are missing spatial information from IUCN, AquaMaps data was used. If a species was assigned an IUCN threat status but did not have spatial range information in either dataset, it was excluded.

This decision to use IUCN data preferentially to AquaMaps data was made based on the fact that experts are developing the IUCN maps and AquaMaps data is based off a computer model, which in some cases is then consulted by an expert and appropriately altered.

Between the two databases, there are 1,923 species that have a range map in both. Figure [X] shows the change in status score for the Species Subgoal within the global Ocean Health Index under three different scenarios. 

![Absolute change in SPP score](figures/SPP_scenarios/boxplot_abs_diff.png)

![Relative change in SPP score](figures/SPP_scenarios/boxplot_rel_diff.png)

Scenario 1 shows change in score if IUCN maps were still preferentially used over AquaMaps, but the AquaMaps threshold was set to 1% rather than 40% probability of occurrence. Scenario 2 shows the change in score if we switched preferences for AquaMaps over IUCN data while keeping the 40% probability of occurrence threshold. The final Scenario is the same as scenario 2 but without a probability of occurrence threshold.


It is important to remember that although only [X (1,923/total number of species)]% of all species included in the species goal are found in both datasets, there are still significant differences when electing to choose one dataset over the other.

- could talk about MPA gap analysis
- Highlights tudies that have used one and not the other. Could this have changed the results?

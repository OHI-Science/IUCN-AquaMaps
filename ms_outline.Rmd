##Main message:

Understanding the differences in marine species range maps from IUCN and AquaMaps, and the implications of using one or both.

##Working Abstract  

Species range maps are integral for spatial analyses across multiple disciplines including geography, conservation, ecology and policy. Two main sources for marine species are the IUCN and AquaMaps. These two datasets differ in development and outcomes, and therefore it is pertinent to understand the implications of using one over the other. AquaMaps uses a computer model based on preferential environmental parameters to predict species locations and probability of occurrence. IUCN uses expert insight to draw polygons around known locations of marine species. Approximately 1,900 species are found in both datasets. This comparative analysis draws attention to the similarities and differences between the two datasets, and highlights the implications of using one or the other in the context of the Ocean Health Index.


##Section One: Understanding each dataset separately  

####**IUCN**  

**Data Type**  
Shapefiles for individual species. Spatial files include subpopulation information, presence (extinct/extant etc.) and seasonality information (breeding/migration/origin etc.).  

**INSERT MAP**  

**Methods**  
From [IUCN site](http://www.iucnredlist.org/technical-documents/red-list-training/iucnspatialresources):  

> The species distribution maps, sometimes referred to as 'limits of distribution' or 'field guide' maps, aim to provide the current known distribution of the species within its native range. The limits of distribution can be determined by using known occurrences of the species, along with the knowledge of habitat preferences, remaining suitable habitat, elevation limited, and other expert knowledge of the species and its range. In most cases the range is depicted as polygons. *A polygon displaying the limits of a species distribution is essentially meant to communicate that the species probably occurs within this polygon, but it does not mean that it is distributed equally within that polygon or occurs everywhere within that polygon*.  


####AquaMaps  

[Site](http://www.aquamaps.org/)

Over 17,000 species  

Computer model using 6 parameters (SST, salinity, temperature, depth, distance to land, sea ice cover)  


AquaMaps uses both occurrence data and environmental parameters to predict relative species occurrence. This approach attempts to reduce sampling bias and fill gaps where data is not available. Six environmental predictors are used to estimate where a species could be found; sea surface temperature, bottom depth, salinity, primary production, sea ice concentration and distance to land. For more information on methods see Kaschner et al. (2007) and online at http://www.aquamaps.org/main/AboutAquaMaps.php.

There are inherent issues with AquaMaps. It can't be expected to accurately predict all marine species ranges. Expert insight is sought and incorporated when available.

##Section Three: Application to OHI

The global Ocean Health Index (Halpern et al. 2012), an index made up of 10 goals, utilizes both of these datasets to inform the  Biodiversity goal. The biodiversity goal is made up of two parts; Species and Habitats. The species subgoal uses the IUCN range map data and threat status to calculate average species status in global ocean regions around the world. Since IUCN only has range maps for X% of total assessed species, AquaMaps provided the data in instances where we have a threat status but no range map.

##Section Four: Implications of data choices
- could talk about MPA gap analysis
- Highlights tudies that have used one and not the other. Could this have changed the results?

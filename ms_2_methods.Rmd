## About the datasets

The IUCN publishes species range maps developed by species experts.  These experts outline spatial boundaries of a given species' "limits of distribution" [@iucn_iucn_2015], based on observation records and informed by expert understanding of species' range and habitat preferences.  ___Fig. SXXX___

In contrast, AquaMaps models species distribution based on environmental preferences, such as temperature, depth, and salinity, deduced from occurrence records, published species databases such as FishBase, and expert knowledge.  The AquaMaps model overlays these environmental preferences atop a map of environmental attributes on a global 0.5° grid to determine suitable habitat, resulting in a "probability of occurrence" for each species.  Of these, 1296 (5.7%) have been further refined through an expert review process [@kaschner_mapping_2006; @ready_predicting_2010]. ___Fig. SXXX___

___OMIT: Studies using AquaMaps data frequently define "presence" by applying a probability threshold, e.g., previously, the Ocean Health Index defined presence as 40% or greater probability of occurrence [@halpern_index_2012; @halpern_patterns_2015].  In the 2016 OHI assessment, the presence threshold was eliminated, to better approximate the "extent of occurrence" generally indicated by IUCN maps, since the two datasets are used together.___

__Comparison of taxonomic and regional distribution__:
To examine the overall taxonomic distribution across the spatial datasets (Fig. 1A), we grouped species by taxonomic class and data source, and determined the proportion of each class represented in each dataset.  

To compare the spatial representation of the two datasets directly, we rasterized the IUCN species polygons to the same 0.5° grid as the AquaMaps species maps; we determined species presence within a grid cell as any non-zero overlap of a species polygon with the cell  ___(Fig. SXXX)___.  For the AquaMaps dataset, we determined per-cell species count by including all species with non-zero probability of occurrence, to best approximate the "extent of occurrence" generally indicated by IUCN maps ___(Fig. SXXX)___.  We represented relative distribution of species count for each dataset by plotting average species count against latitude and longitude (Fig. 1B, 1C).

__Comparison of paired maps__:
Using genus and species binomials as a matching key, we identified "paired map" species - the subset of marine species that have range maps in both IUCN and AquaMaps current native distribution.  We used the taxize package [@REF] in R [@REF] to standardize species names and synonyms; for species with separate subpopulation maps in IUCN, we combined all subpopulations to create a single global population.   For each of these paired map species, we determined species presence within each spatial cell for each dataset using the same criteria outlined above.

Overlaying paired distribution maps for each species, we defined and calculated _distribution alignment_ $\alpha_{dist}$ and _area ratio_ $\alpha_{area}$:

$$\alpha_{dist} = \frac{A_{small \cap large}}{A_{large}} * 100\%$$

$$\alpha_{area} = \frac{A_{small}}{A_{large}} * 100\%$$

For each paired map species, $A_{small}$ and $A_{large}$ indicate the smaller and larger range representation (regardless of which dataset).  $A_{small \cap large}$ represents the amount of overlapping area between the two datasets.  

Distribution alignment uses overlapping predictions of presence as means of identifying areas of higher confidence.  Area ratio provides a proxy for frequency of commission and/or omission errors.

To examine errors of commission related to depth, we selected corals as a case study due to their importance in supporting biodiversity as well as their dependence on photosynthesis.  Extracting data from the IUCN API [@REF?] we identified the depth limitations of each of the coral species mapped in the IUCN dataset.  We created a 200 m bathymetry raster from Natural Earth's 200 m bathymetry polygon [@natural_earth_XXX] ___(Fig. SXXX)___ and masked our IUCN coral rasters to identify mapped coral presence below 200 m.  The resulting maps were again compared to the AquaMaps rasters to examine distribution alignment and area ratio.

AquaMaps uses Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) Major Fishing Area [@REF] boundaries as a rough method of constraining species ranges to appropriate georegions.  To explore the impact of these artificial constraints on species range predictions, we chose to focus on boundaries defined by longitude, as they seem less likely to relate to ecological conditions than boundaries defined by latitude.  As an example, we identified all AquaMaps species whose eastern or western range limit between between 5° S and 25° N latitudes coincided with the large vertical boundary between FAO regions 71 and 77 at 175° W longitude.  

To identify data-poor species, we used the ___robis???___ and ___rgbif???___ packages [@REFS] in R to identify known occurrences of each species; occurrences were averaged between the two occurrence databases as a proxy for data richness.

## Methods for Ocean Health Index (OHI) case study

The global Ocean Health Index (OHI) [@halpern_index_2012; @halpern_patterns_2015], a composite index comprising ten sustainable benefits provided by a healthy ocean, uses species spatial distribution data to calculate biodiversity status for each of the world's 221 exclusive economic zones. 

The Species component of the OHI Biodiversity goal (abbreviated as SPP) uses IUCN Red List extinction risk as a proxy for a species' health.  Each species is assigned a risk score based on IUCN Red List extinction risk category, from Least Concern (0.0) to Extinct (1.0) (Data Deficient and unassessed species are excluded).  Species range is determined from its IUCN range map, where available, or its AquaMaps range map if an IUCN map is unavailable.  For each assessed OHI region, an area-weighted mean extinction risk across all species is calculated, and rescaled to calculate a status score from 0 (mean extinction risk = 0.75) to 100 (mean extinction risk = 0) [@halpern_index_2012; @halpern_patterns_2015].

_To highlight the differences in the datasets, we recalculated the OHI SPP status values using only one complete dataset at a time, and compared to the values resulting from the combined datasets.  For the AquaMaps dataset, we used a "probability of occurrence" threshold of 0% to determine presence, to align with the OHI 2016 assessment._  

## Methods for MPA Gap Analysis case study
To assess the effectiveness of MPAs in protecting biodiversity, Klein et al. [-@klein_shortfalls_2015] compared the coverage of the global MPA network presented by the World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) [@iucn_world_2014] to the species ranges described in the 2014 AquaMaps dataset [@aquamaps_XXX].  For the primary analysis, the researchers defined species presence as 50% or greater probability of occurrence.

To reconstruct the primary analysis, we selected the subset of protected areas from the 2014 WDPA dataset classified as IUCN protected area management categories I-IV and spatially overlapping a marine area. The WDPA polygons and marine polygons were rasterized to 0.01° and then aggregated to AquaMaps native 0.5° cells, to calculate proportion of marine protected area within each cell.  After verifying our results using the 2014 AquaMaps dataset, we updated the analysis to use the 2015 AquaMaps dataset, at a presence threshold of 50% (to compare to Klein et al. directly) and 0% (to better compare with IUCN spatial data).  To analyze MPA coverage against IUCN spatial data, we extracted IUCN polygon weights per 0.5° cell for each species and compared against the protected area raster.  Finally, we combined AquaMaps data (at 0% threshold) and IUCN data, using AquaMaps for the `r format(n_spp_both, big.mark = ',')` overlapping species and again compared against the protected area raster.

All processing was completed using R statistical software [@r_core_team_r:_2016], and all code and intermediate data are available on GitHub at https://github.com/OHI-Science/IUCN-AquaMaps.

_About the datasets__:

The IUCN publishes species range maps based on expert input of spatial boundaries of a given species' "limits of distribution" [@iucn_iucn_2015] - essentially a refined extent of occurrence (EOO), based on observation records and informed by expert understanding of species' range and habitat preferences.  In contrast, AquaMaps models species distribution based on environmental preferences (e.g., temperature, depth, salinity) deduced from occurrence records, published species databases such as FishBase, and expert knowledge.  The AquaMaps model overlays these environmental preferences atop a map of environmental attributes on a 0.5 degree grid, creating a global map of "probability of occurrence" for each species [@kaschner_mapping_2006; @ready_predicting_2010].  Studies using AquaMaps data frequently define "presence" by applying a probability threshold, e.g., the Ocean Health Index defines presence as 40% or greater probability of occurrence [@halpern_index_2012; @halpern_patterns_2015].

___should this go in the discussion?___
_The methodologies behind the creation of these datasets imply differences in prediction of species distribution due to errors of commission (falsely indicating species presence) and omission (falsely indicating species absence).  Geographic range data such as IUCN range maps frequently introduce commission errors, while species distribution models such as AquaMaps will likely introduce fewer commission errors but more omission errors.  Each type of error bears different implications for conservation goals: commission errors can result in prioritizing areas not relevant to conservation goals, while omission errors may result in protected area networks that fail to include important habitat and range [@rondinini_tradeoffs_2006].  By comparing maps resulting from IUCN and AquaMaps methodologies, we can identify and possibly address mechanistic causes for each type of error._

__Comparison of taxonomic and regional distribution__:
To examine the overall taxonomic distribution across the spatial datasets (Fig. 1A), we grouped species by taxonomic class and data source (IUCN, AquaMaps, or both), and examined the proportion of each class represented in each data source category.

To compare the spatial representation of the two datasets directly, we rasterized the IUCN species polygons to the same 0.5째 grid as the AquaMaps species maps; we determined species presence within a grid cell as any non-zero overlap of a species polygon with the cell.  For the AquaMaps dataset, we determined per-cell species count by including all species with non-zero probability of occurrence, to best approximate the "extent of occurrence" generally indicated by IUCN maps.  We represented relative distribution of species count for each dataset by plotting average species count against latitude and longitude (Fig. 1B, 1C).

__Comparison of paired maps__:
Using genus and species binomials as a matching key, we selected the subset of marine species that have range maps in both IUCN and AquaMaps current native distribution.  ___To avoid double-counting, we removed subpopulations and species aliases. Used the taxize package? which version?___  We determined species presence within each spatial cell using the same criteria outlined above.

Overlaying paired distribution maps for a given species, we defined and calculated _distribution alignment_ and _area ratio_ and plotted these in Fig. 2A:

$$\alpha_{dist} = \frac{A_{small \cap large}}{A_{large}} * 100\%$$

$$\alpha_{area} = \frac{A_{small}}{A_{large}} * 100\%$$

For each species with ranges described in both IUCN and AquaMaps, $A_{small}$ and $A_{large}$ indicate the smaller and larger range representation (regardless of which dataset).  $A_{small \cap large}$ represents the amount of overlapping area between the two datasets.  

_Distribution alignment - overlap as proxy for common understanding; use Bayesian argument to show that these areas are high-confidence areas; area ratio as proxy for errors of commission/omission.  While we cannot know which dataset is closer to the "truth" we can make inferences based on expectations of EOO and AOO maps - is AquaMaps AOO?_

Dividing the plot into quadrants based on mean values along each axis, we roughly categorized four qualities of alignment, and for each taxonomic group, based on IUCN taxonomic groupings, determined the proportion of species that fell into each quality category (2B).  

Noting that a large proportion of corals were identified in the upper-left quadrant, we examined a handful of IUCN coral maps and found that each predicted coral presence in far deeper waters than would be expected based on the IUCN's habitat description.  To examine this issue further, we created a 200 m bathymetry raster from Natural Earth's 200 m bathymetry polygon [@natural_earth???] and masked our IUCN coral rasters to constrain the maps to shallow waters.  None of the paired-map corals is described as occurring deeper than 200 m, ___and most are found in far shallower waters.___  The resulting maps were again compared to the AquaMaps rasters; ___figure X___ plots shifts in coral species alignment due to this depth clipping.

**Methods for Ocean Health Index (OHI) case study:**
The Species component of the OHI Biodiversity goal (SPP) uses IUCN Red List extinction risk as a proxy for a species' health.  Each species is assigned a risk score based on IUCN Red List extinction risk category, from Least Concern (0.0) to Extinct (1.0) (Data Deficient and unassessed species are excluded).  Species range is determined from its IUCN range map, where available, or its AquaMaps range map ("presence" defined as a 40% or greater probability of occurrence) if an IUCN map is unavailable.  For each assessed OHI region, an area-weighted mean extinction risk across all species is calculated, and rescaled from 0 (mean extinction risk = 0.75) to 100 (mean extinction risk = 0) [@halpern_index_2012; @halpern_patterns_2015].  

___For our analysis, we modified the original code for OHI 2015 Species status, allowing for flexibility in which data source was used for the overlapping species, and flexibility in modifying the AquaMaps presence threshold.  Using the output of the published OHI 2015 SPP status as our baseline, we ran the modified SPP code three times: once with IUCN  prioritizing IUCN over AquaMaps for a 0% threshold, and prioritizing AquaMaps over IUCN for both a 40% and 0% threshold.  We compared each of these to the output of the published OHI 2015 SPP status.___

_To highlight the differences in the datasets, we selected the subset of species whose ranges are represented in both datasets.  In the original OHI SPP analysis, IUCN data was used to determine ranges for these overlapping species; we calculated the SPP status for these species as our baseline.  We then recalculated using AquaMaps ranges at a 40% presence threshold (as used in the original OHI analysis) and a 0% threshold (to better simulate the "limits of distribution" defined by IUCN maps) and compared them to our IUCN baseline._

_We then modified the original OHI source code to recalculate the 2015 SPP status, using AquaMaps rather than IUCN for the overlapping species, and setting a 0% presence threshold on all AquaMaps species ranges.  This we compared to the original SPP status scores for 2015._

**Methods for MPA Gap Analysis case study:** 
To assess the effectiveness of MPAs in protecting biodiversity, Klein et al. [-@klein_shortfalls_2015] compared the coverage of the global MPA network presented by the World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) [@iucn_world_2014] to the species ranges described in the 2014 AquaMaps dataset.  For this study, the researchers defined "presence" as 50% or greater probability of occurrence.  

To reconstruct the primary analysis, we selected the subset of protected areas from the 2014 WDPA dataset classified as IUCN protected area management categories I-IV and spatially covering a marine area. The WDPA polygons and marine polygons were rasterized to 0.01째 and then aggregated to AquaMaps native 0.5째 cells, to calculate proportion of marine protected area within each cell.  After verifying our results using the 2014 AquaMaps dataset, we updated the analysis to use the 2015 AquaMaps dataset, at a presence threshold of 50% (to compare to Klein et al. directly) and 0% (to better compare with IUCN spatial data).  To analyze MPA coverage against IUCN spatial data, we extracted IUCN polygon weights per 0.5째 cell for each species and compared against the protected area raster.  Finally, we combined AquaMaps data (at 0% threshold) and IUCN data, using AquaMaps for the `r format(n_spp_both, big.mark = ',')` overlapping species and again compared against the protected area raster.

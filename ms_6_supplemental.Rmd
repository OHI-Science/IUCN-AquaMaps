# Supplemental Information

### illustrative maps for different quadrants and different mechanistic problems

### descriptions of IUCN and AM data sets

IUCN: While the polygons roughly define regions of presence/absence, additional attributes provide information on extant/extinct ranges, native/introduced ranges, and seasonality.

As of December 2015, IUCN had published species distribution maps for `r nrow(spp_iucn_maps)` marine species across 24 taxonomic groups.  For this analysis, we did not consider IUCN range maps for bird species, as those data are hosted separately by BirdLife International.

 As of December 2015, AquaMaps current native distribution maps have been produced for `r nrow(spp_am)` species.  
 
 ___Move to supplementary materials. - BH___: For example, as of this writing, IUCN has released no spatial data for class Elasmobranchii (cartilaginous fishes including sharks and rays); and while IUCN offers a large number of maps within class Actinopterygii (ray-finned bony fishes), the available maps include only a few primarily tropical taxonomic sub-groups, such as wrasses, damselfish, butterflyfish, tunas, and billfishes, but are missing economically important subgroups including salmon, rockfish, and clupeids.  However, IUCN's criterion of comprehensive assessment greatly reduces the risk of sample bias within the bounds of the assessed taxonomic groups.

___Probably just cut, but maybe include in Suppl Materials. - BH___: The release of AquaMaps distribution maps is not limited to comprehensively-assessed taxa, and maps are available across a much larger range of taxonomic classes; however, there is no guarantee that the list of species included within each class is a representative cross section of the entire class.

___Red List inclusion:___

* _All IUCN-mapped species are also included in Red List species, but only `r p_spp_am_rl`% of AquaMaps species._

* Breaking down the quadrants by IUCN extinction risk categories (FIG 3c), we found that species with higher extinction risk tend to be better aligned between the two datasets, perhaps correlated to increased expert scrutiny.  Does higher perceived risk lead to increased attention, and thus better understanding of species distribution? Or conversely, does increased attention to species distribution reveal more species at risk?  Likely both mechanisms are at play on a case-by-case basis, depending on the species' taxon and region. _does this argument bear up to closer scrutiny? CR isn't dominated by Q1 any more_

## AquaMaps: Effect of changing "presence" threshold on apparent distribution

### AquaMaps presence threshold analysis - move to SOM

For our comparisons of global distribution of represented biodiversity and spatial alignment between datasets, we considered "present" to be any cell with a non-zero probability of occurrence, to best approximate the "extent of occurrence" as generally indicated by IUCN maps.  To examine the effect of different presence threshold selections on the represented range of a species, we varied the threshold from 0.05 to 1.00 and calculated the average species range relative to a zero threshold.

### Figure 5 (a, b):

>AquaMaps distribution map extent remaining after applying a presence threshold.  (a) A 40% threshold applied to all species in the AquaMaps dataset shows a mean loss of XXX, with a wide distribution in which some species lose nearly all of their apparent range.  (b) Mean (median) remaining extent at increments of presence threshold. Dark grey ribbon includes 25% to 75% quantiles, while light grey ribbon includes 9% to 91% quantiles.


AquaMaps distribution maps indicate "probability of occurrence" within each 0.5Â° cell, with values ranging from zero to one, rather than a simple present/absent value as indicated by IUCN maps.  Many studies convert this AquaMaps probability to a simple presence value by assigning a threshold value (REF references here).  A higher threshold constrains an analysis to cells with near certainty of occurrence, while a low threshold captures larger areas of increasingly marginal suitability.

At a presence threshold of 40%, as used in the Ocean Health Index Species subgoal, the bulk of AquaMaps species suffer a significant decrease in represented range, and some species lose nearly their entire range.  Incrementing the presence threshold from 0.00 to 1.00 for the entire AquaMaps dataset, the shallow downward trend indicates a low but consistent sensitivity to threshold choice, with no surprising tradeoffs that could suggest an "optimal" threshold.  This pattern may not hold true for all subsets of AquaMaps species, however, whether subsetting by taxa or by georegion.

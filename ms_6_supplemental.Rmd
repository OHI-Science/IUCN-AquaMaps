 ___Move to supplementary materials. - BH___: For example, as of this writing, IUCN has released no spatial data for class Elasmobranchii (cartilaginous fishes including sharks and rays); and while IUCN offers a large number of maps within class Actinopterygii (ray-finned bony fishes), the available maps include only a few primarily tropical taxonomic sub-groups, such as wrasses, damselfish, butterflyfish, tunas, and billfishes, but are missing economically important subgroups including salmon, rockfish, and clupeids.  However, IUCN's criterion of comprehensive assessment greatly reduces the risk of sample bias within the bounds of the assessed taxonomic groups.

___Probably just cut, but maybe include in Suppl Materials. - BH___: The release of AquaMaps distribution maps is not limited to comprehensively-assessed taxa, and maps are available across a much larger range of taxonomic classes; however, there is no guarantee that the list of species included within each class is a representative cross section of the entire class.
